                            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a relevant topic for the modern digital age
                            and computer professionals. We work with data daily,
                            and seldom pay much attention to data subjects from which the data originated. The
                            primary guiding principle of the EU, for this initial discussion,
                            is human rights. The definition includes “the right to the protection of your data” (EU,
                            2020). Therefore, we can argue that
                            GDPR is as much about protecting my data as it is protecting yours. We are, after all,
                            human. Freedom of movement (which includes people,
                            goods, finances, and data) is another guiding principle of the EU. It is reasonable to
                            assume that the EU seeks personal data protection even
                            as it protects citizens’ rights and liberties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Businesses operating or processing EU citizens’ data require sturdy codes of conduct
                            that deal with data privacy to implement the fundamental EU
                            human rights. BCS (2019) note that up to 1/3 of all information system (IS) software
                            products contain sensitive or personal data. For
                            this reason, every Data Privacy code of conduct must incorporate systems and their
                            fundamental capabilities to process and store data.
                            For instance, BCS (2019) states that some systems cannot remove such data despite no
                            further need. Such a limitation falls foul of GDPR’s
                            requirement regarding the length of data retention. It could, if discovered, result in
                            penalties or worse, financial fines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One would think that given the strict requirements for GDPR principles, most business
                            owners in the UK would be aware of the financial
                            costs of not implementing GDPR. However, Ayala et al. (2018) note in their introduction
                            that, according to the Institute of Directors who polled
                            869 UK directors, 30% did not know about GDPR while 40% did not know of its impact. The
                            main concern being the “vague, ambiguous, and verbose nature
                            of regulations, which individuals … often find difficult to understand” (Ayala et al.,
                            2018). So, it seems, if directors struggle to get to
                            grips with GDPR, then more so for IT professionals. Here BCS (2020) advocates (in their
                            code of conduct,
                            Appendix 1) that IT professionals act in the public interest and protect personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, GDPR knowledge is beneficial to all IT professionals (who work with customer
                            data); not only GDPR roles as data controller,
                            protection officer, or processor. Unified knowledge can be codified into a well-designed
                            business code of conduct and will guide a business
                            from a place of uncertainty (as the 40% above) to a stronger sense of certainty,
                            regarding data privacy and regulations. It may often
                            be daunting for companies to consider what a GDPR-focused code of conduct should
                            contain, however, CJ (2018) recommend that a code of conduct be
                            approved by all staff members and must address all GDPR points as specified by EU
                            regulations. With this in hand, every business will have knowledge
                            of data privacy and how it impacts their customers and themselves. Human right to your
                            data will remain intact.
