						Hi, welcome.  My name is Michael Justus and I enjoy creating software systems. 
					</p>
					<div>
						Below are some of the tools, languages and databases I have used through life. Like an uncooked Brussel Sprout, 
						the list is bland without a little something extra. In the IT industry, if there is one maxim that remains true
						after many years
						<blockquote>
							<em>The only constant is 'change'</em>
						</blockquote>

					<h3 class="mb-1">So, an MSc?</h3>
					<div>
						Behind every beautiful garden flower, lie toils of seeds and bulbs, planted by a gardener,
						whose desire is the delight of colourful summer splendour to their eyes.

						Knowledge is as the beautiful tulips above: it takes hard work, but the outcome is a glorious
						display in due time. So, likewise, taking an MSc in Computer Science is for no other reason that to add 
						to the garden of my mind; to allow new ideas to blossom. I believe an MSc may enrich my life, 
						understanding of IT, information systems and computer science on a deeper level than I currently posses. And, 
						I hold firm to the belief that every person must pursue knowledge if whatever topic they take interest.

					<h3 class="mb-1">Why Computer Science?</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							I started my current career in software development, many moons ago. I chose software because of its problem-solving
							nature; the thrill of commanding a machine to bow to its human overlord! (Oh the irony <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> poses).
							It was a journey of thrilling adventure and excitement to write the first program in Basic and Pascal and to uncover
							the nuances of manipulating code to make small, uninteresting games or programs.
						</p>

						<p>
							I suppose, looking back on life, computer science formed how I think, or perhaps how I think is <em>why</em> I gravitated toward
							computers, their algorithms and systems. I cannot tell. I think in some way, the journey was set the moment my mother brought home
							a new "toy", a computer. And the inner intrigues grew from there.
						</p>

					<h3 class="mb-1">What have you learned in your career?</h3>
					<div>
						<ul>

						<li>
						
									<strong><em>The old is new; yet the new becomes old.</em></strong> New framework, same concept.
							
									The industry started with <strong>mainframes</strong> and <strong>client-server</strong> together with <strong>thin clients</strong>.
									Through the years, industry then moved to the idea of <strong>thick clients</strong> and <strong>PCs</strong> (away from mainframes). 
									Yet today, the industry once more moves to client-server models (aka, <strong>cloud</strong> services, albeit with numerous differences, though the
									<em>concept</em> mimicks what came before).
						
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong><em>You cannot know everything.</em></strong> Many frameworks comes and go, and there will <em>always</em> be a new one around the 
							corner that promises some new functionality which was not present in the existing frameworks. Keeping up with each and every new 
							tool on the market is unproductive; better to rely on those who <em>do</em> specialise in the new tools and frameworks.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong><em>Team-work trumps self-work.</em></strong> Working collaboratively is leads to better success. While there certainly are moments of 
							time to shine as a single, atomic entity, majority of time is best spent working <em>with</em> team members.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong><em>Be humble, willing to learn.</em></strong> There exists a saying, <em>"Rotten apple spoils the cart"</em>. It refers to 
							the impact negative behaviour can have on those around us. How wonderful for progress when team members are willing to take
							advice, guidance or constructive feedback! Indeed, I have found it wonderful to freely share knowledge with those around me that 
							aids in their upliftment.
