<header>GDPR and Code of Conduct Conclusion</header>
<div class="post-content">
        <p>
            Over the course of the last three units in this module, we
            looked at the various roles and responsibilities of IT
            professionals, computer architecture and emerging trends
            within the industry. These three units of discussion
            integrate with the discussion around GDPR and data privacy
            in today's world.

            Computer science professionals possess skills that are not
            purely theoretical but also very much practical. They have a
            deep understanding of algorithms and how these are used with
            data to derive new insights and solutions to industry
            problems. However, with data processing comes additional
            threats to the data; data must be protected at all times.
            There are ethical, moral and possible legal implications for
            the misappropriation (whether intentionally or otherwise) of
            sensitive or confidential data. IT professionals have a
            responsibility to ensure such data breaches do not occur
            within their organisation, and such responsibilities are
            codified in a Code of Conduct policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The European Union's introduction of GDPR regulations in 2018
            (EU_1, 2021) set a new world-standard as being the toughest
            collection of privacy laws in the world. This new Code of
            Conduct, so to speak, brings greater responsibility for IT
            professionals to consider each and every piece of user data
            they wish to process or manipulate in their chosen IT
            systems. No longer can organisations simply gather data
            freely and pay no heed to their intended use of the data.
            GDPR places heavy fines on organisations who fail to respect
            the fundamental rights of European citizens' right to
            privacy, with regulation supporting fines of up to ten
            million Euros or two percent of an organisation's revenue
            (EU_2, 2021). These are no small figures for organisations
            who wish to perform business in the EU.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, given the financial implications involved, IT
            professionals, driven by a sound Code of Conduct, ought to
            harness opportunities in their day-to-day tasks to watch for
            potential data breaches, regularly review data processing
            processes and assess the impact of providing third-party
            vendors with their organisation's data. Also, if data must
            be tested within IT systems, (as is good practice before
            production releases) Blair et al. (2019) recommend the data
            be (pseudo)anonymised in order to remain within the GDPR
            regulations.

            Considering the impact of GDPR, discussions revealed there is
            a heavy financial and training cost involved to ensure
            compliance. Most organisations lack knowledge of what is
            required or even how to implement GDPR policies. For this
            point, reference was made to ISO standard 27701 (Std_Iso,
            2021) and BS 10012 2017 + A1 2018 (Std_BS, 2018). These
            standards serve are starting points for organisations to
            consider implementing data privacy. Due to the financial
            cost of GDPR policies, it was discussed that smaller
            companies very likely would implement the bare minimum to
            not risk fines (Holmes, 2021). However, the idea that
            training is essential was a key theme that can easily be
            deduced from the discussions: organisations must rise to the
            challenge of data privacy and enable better compliance
            through regular training of their staff. Improved compliance
            is achieved through greater awareness of an organisation's
            data privacy policies both internally and externally.

            Users are realising the value of their data, and in the years
            ahead, they will demand greater responsibility for their
            data from Big Tech companies. As more and more businesses
            look to leverage new opportunities to profit from data, the
            concept of Big Data has become a major concern for existing
            regulations as well as users. Big Tech have the money and
            motivation to mine more data at an ever increasing pace
            while still trying to maintain a balance between their own
            needs and the need to respect their data privacy. The
            current implementation of GDPR may soon find difficulties
            among organisations as they move their operations over to
            Cloud Computing; users are not always aware of what they can
            or cannot do with the data they access. However, in due
            course, users too will gain the requisite knowledge
            concerning their right to data privacy, and as more
            organisations around the globe (EU_3, ND.) recognise the
            efforts of the EU's GDPR, data privacy may become an
            in-built quality of all systems consumed and produced.
