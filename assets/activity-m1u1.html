        General Data Protection Regulation
        (GDPR) is
        a relevant topic for the modern digital
        age
        and computer professionals. We work with
        data daily,
        and seldom pay much attention to data
        subjects from which the data originated.
        The
        primary guiding principle of the EU, for
        this initial discussion,
        is human rights. The definition includes
        “the right to the protection of your
        data”
        (EU,
        2020). Therefore, we can argue that
        GDPR is as much about protecting my data
        as
        it is protecting yours. We are, after
        all,
        human. Freedom of movement (which
        includes
        people,
        goods, finances, and data) is another
        guiding principle of the EU. It is
        reasonable to
        assume that the EU seeks personal data
        protection even
        as it protects citizens’ rights and
        liberties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Businesses operating or processing EU
        citizens’ data require sturdy codes of
        conduct
        that deal with data privacy to implement
        the
        fundamental EU
        human rights. BCS (2019) note that up to
        1/3
        of all information system (IS) software
        products contain sensitive or personal
        data.
        For
        this reason, every Data Privacy code of
        conduct must incorporate systems and
        their
        fundamental capabilities to process and
        store data.
        For instance, BCS (2019) states that
        some
        systems cannot remove such data despite
        no
        further need. Such a limitation falls
        foul
        of GDPR’s
        requirement regarding the length of data
        retention. It could, if discovered,
        result
        in
        penalties or worse, financial fines.

        One would think that given the strict
        requirements for GDPR principles, most
        business
        owners in the UK would be aware of the
        financial
        costs of not implementing GDPR. However,
        Ayala et al. (2018) note in their
        introduction
        that, according to the Institute of
        Directors who polled
        869 UK directors, 30% did not know about
        GDPR while 40% did not know of its
        impact.
        The
        main concern being the “vague,
        ambiguous,
        and verbose nature
        of regulations, which individuals …
        often
        find difficult to understand” (Ayala et
        al.,
        2018). So, it seems, if directors
        struggle
        to get to
        grips with GDPR, then more so for IT
        professionals. Here BCS (2020) advocates
        (in
        their
        code of conduct,
        Appendix 1) that IT professionals act in
        the
        public interest and protect personal
        data.

        Therefore, GDPR knowledge is beneficial
        to
        all IT professionals (who work with
        customer
        data); not only GDPR roles as data
        controller,
        protection officer, or processor.
        Unified
        knowledge can be codified into a
        well-designed
        business code of conduct and will guide
        a
        business
        from a place of uncertainty (as the 40%
        above) to a stronger sense of certainty,
        regarding data privacy and regulations.
        It
        may often
        be daunting for companies to consider
        what a
        GDPR-focused code of conduct should
        contain, however, CJ (2018) recommend
        that a
        code of conduct be
        approved by all staff members and must
        address all GDPR points as specified by
        EU
        regulations. With this in hand, every
        business will have knowledge
        of data privacy and how it impacts their
        customers and themselves. Human right to
        your
        data will remain intact.
