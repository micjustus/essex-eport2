<header>Discussion Post Summary: <h4>Information System Failures</h4></header>

<div class="post-content">
    <p>Over three weeks, consideration was given to defining information systems (IS). A high-level definition of an
        information system is a system that processes data with context to provide information. Given this definition,
        information systems are pervasive in our modern society wherever electronic data processing is required.</p>

    <p>Looking into reported IS failures, the single reason information systems fail is an unknown operating condition,
        whether the condition originates from data, device or human involvement. Many of the discussion points referred
        to a lack of testing, monitoring or extremely poor or non-existent auditing processes. Therefore, a takeaway is
        that data is a fundamental component; designers must ensure that all conditions supporting said data (storage,
        transport, security, transformation, traceability) are defined and well-documented. Moreover, such processes
        must be alive and well established long before deploying any IS for public use. According to Gauld (2006), IS
        failures are common, with most failures (84 per cent) occurring in the public sector. Therefore, all information
        systems stakeholders must consider the value of the underlying data and associated processes. Steward (2021)
        considers that IS security is often an afterthought; so, incorporating security must occur early on within each
        IS design stage when utilising a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) methodology.</p>

    <p>During the Design Phase of the SDLC methodology, IS designers often leverage Object-Oriented designs to model
        real-world “objects” as it is easier to model based on real-world concepts (object) and interactions
        (behaviours) than it is to build systems using abstract notions. However, a quote from C.A.R Hoare (as cited in
        Pressman:218, 2010) nicely sums up the difficulty of designing systems: “There are two ways of constructing a
        software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is
        to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.”</p>

    <p>Lastly, I consider that IS failures reflect the difficulty for humans to test every possible permutation on every
        possible hardware configuration. As a result, IT professionals carry greater responsibility in reducing possible
        failures. Thankfully, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are two emerging trends that may come to our
        aid (Soto et al., 2019)</p>
