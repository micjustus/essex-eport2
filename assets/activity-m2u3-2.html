    <header>UML Practical Activity: <h4>Object Diagram</h4>
    </header>
    <h4>Diagram Description</h4>

    <p>The UML diagram presented is my first attempt at representig a fictitious supermarket. The practical activity was
        designed to
        get students to consider UML conventions and types of relationships; to think in terms of
        <strong>objects</strong> and their
        <strong>relationships</strong> such as <strong>Association</strong>, <strong>Specialization</strong>,
        <strong>Composition</strong>
        and <strong>Aggregation</strong> relationships as well as the <strong>multiplicities</strong>
        (and names) of relationships.
    </p>

    <h4>Method to Develop the Diagram</h4>
    <p>In considering the <strong>objects</strong> of the fictitious supermarket, I relied on <strong>forming
            sentences</strong> to help
        identify all objects of the system. Then, I drafted initial diagrams and thereafter, based on further revisions
        of the diagrams, I produced a UML object model to observe the model at a single point in time.

        I found the approach works in tandem with my way of thinking about modelling for the practical activity, and
        helps me to understand the benefits of modelling object models first versus <strong>class diagrams</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Sentences used to identify objects:</p>

    <ul class="left-align">
        <li><code>Staff</code> works with one or more <code>Order Processing Device</code>s.</li>
        <li>An Order Processing Device is either a <code>Mobile Shopper Scanner</code> or a <code>Till</code>.</li>
        <li>An Order Processing Device scans a <code>Customer</code>'s <code>Loyalty Card</code>.</li>
        <li>A Loyalty Card is part of a <code>Loyalty Scheme</code>.</li>
        <li>A Loyalty Scheme</> is either Basic or provides Double Points.</li>
        <li>A <code>Supplier</code> can provide one or more <code>Product</code>s.</li>
        <li>A Customer participates in zero or one Loyalty Schemes.</li>
        <li>A Customer resides at a single <code>Address</code>.</li>
        <li>A Customer will perform a checkout operation either by themself OR by interacting with a
            Staff member (who acts in a particular <code>Role</code>).
        </li>
        <li>An Order Processing Device is used to process a Customer's <code>Order</code>
            which is an <code>Order Basket</code>.</li>
        <li>An Order consists of one or more Products.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        First is presented the object diagram for this activity. Following are the modelling attempts taken to arrive at
        the
        final object diagram.
    </p>

    

    <h5>Attempt #1</h5>
    <p>The following diagram is based on the sentences described:</p>

        <figcaption>UML object model (1<sup>st</sup> draft)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h5>Attempt #2</h5>
    <p>However, reviewing the model, I noted that the first draft does not quite follow my real-world
        experience. So modelling my experience of using <strong>Sainbury's (UK)</strong> as inspiration, 
        resulted in a second revision shown below:
    </p>

        <img class="practical-activity"
             src="/assets/css/images/Activity_1_UML_Model_1_b.png"
             alt="Supermarket UML model (version 2)"></img>
        <figcaption>UML object model (2<sup>nd</sup> draft)</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>I like the second attempt a lot more than the first attempt, because of the introduction of the following:</p>
    <ul class="left-align">
        <li><strong>Association Classes</strong>.<br />
            <p>
                <code>Order</code> is now an association class between
                <code>Customer</code> and <code>Order Capture Device</code>. This implies that an Order
                <strong>must</strong>
                exist when a Customer is associated with an Order Capture Device.

                <code>Product List</code> is also an association clause because the list of <code>Product</code>
                must
                be passed from a <code>Mobile Shopper Scanner</code> to a <code>Self Checkout Till</code> whenever a
                Customer wishes to conclude their Order using the self-checkout route.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Receipt</strong>.
            <p>
                The model shows that a <code>Receipt</code> is generated by either a Self Checkout Till or
                a normal <code>Till</code> instance.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Order Capture Device.</strong>
            <p>
                The model shows that a Customer can use three different methods to
                process their Order.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Final Object Diagram</h5>
    <p>I generated a few object diagrams to test the assumptions of the final object model based on each potential <strong>use case</strong>
    the model must be able to handle. </p>

    <ul>

        <li>Customer uses the <code>Mobile Shopper Scanner</code>
